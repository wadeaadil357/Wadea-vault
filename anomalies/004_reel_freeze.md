# Anomaly 004: Reel Freeze

**Date Observed:** April 2025  
**Platform:** Instagram  
**Post Type:** Reel  
**Behavior:** Stalled mid-surge with no explanation

---

## Description:
A reel posted with strong opening traction (views, shares, saves) abruptly froze—both in analytics and surface interaction. Comments slowed, views remained static for days, and visibility appeared capped.

Pre-freeze performance:
- Initial momentum consistent with high-resonance posts
- Visual content symbolic (e.g. flame, glitch, eye contact, sacred space)
- Caption included reclamation language

---

## Possible Triggers:
- Real-time visibility control by algorithm  
- Content auto-flagged as “non-boostable”  
- Manual review shadowlimiting  
- Reel formatting triggering political/spiritual flags

---

## Pattern Flagged:
- **View freeze after first 200–500 interactions**  
- **Static reach on story shares and suggested page views**  
- **Comments remained open, but slowed unnaturally**
