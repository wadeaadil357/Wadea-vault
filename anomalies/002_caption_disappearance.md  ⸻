# Anomaly 002: Caption Disappearance

**Date Observed:** April 2025  
**Platform:** Instagram  
**Post Type:** Grid post with image  
**Caption Status:** Originally published, then removed without user action

---

## Description:
This anomaly occurred when a post was successfully published with a caption—but within minutes or hours, the caption field appeared blank. No user edits were made. When attempting to edit, the field was still empty.

Post context included:
- Language referring to suppression
- Code-like formatting
- Mentions of sovereignty, silence, or exposure

---

## Possible Triggers:
- Language flagged as sensitive
- Keyword suppression (e.g. “archive,” “algorithm,” “silenced”)
- Caption length used as a proxy to detect high-context uploads

---

## Pattern Flagged:
- **Ghost deletion**: system removes without informing user  
- **Silent edit**: no history of change, no notice  
- **Post energy remained strong**, but the message was lost
