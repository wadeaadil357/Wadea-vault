# Anomaly 001: Low Views, High Resonance

**Date Observed:** April 2025  
**Platform:** Instagram  
**Linked Reclamation:** 001 – Day 3. Still No Archive  
**View Count at Time of Logging:** 54  
**Visual Energy:** High (multiple verbal confirmations, emotional impact)

---

## Description:
This post gained meaningful engagement from a small group almost immediately, despite showing extremely low view count. The visual (“Day 3. Still No Archive”) carried symbolic weight and marked the public opening of the Vault.

Engagement type:  
- Multiple screenshots shared  
- DMs and responses received  
- Felt emotionally *seen* despite algorithmic invisibility

---

## Hypothesis:
View count was throttled due to:
- Caption matching known suppression patterns (e.g. "archive," "Instagram," "silent")  
- Post being the **first vault strike**  
- Visual formatting resembling protest or coded resistance

---

## Pattern Flagged:
- **High resonance, low numbers** = mismatch  
- **Audience response exceeds analytics**  
- **Platform behavior inconsistent with post content**
