# Anomaly 008: The Loop Glitch

**Date Observed:** April 2025  
**Platform:** Instagram  
**Post Type:** Repost (manual or recreated)  
**Behavior:** Reposting a previously published post resulted in worse reach, view count, and engagement—even when the first post was underperforming

---

## Description:
Wadea reposted content that had either been hidden, glitched, or undervalued by the system. Despite stronger captioning, intentional timing, and confirmed audience interest, the repost *performed worse* than the original.

Patterns:
- Repost received lower views than first  
- Often fewer likes despite higher saves  
- Followers reported not seeing the repost either

---

## Possible Triggers:
- Instagram tagging repost as “duplicate content”  
- Caption match throttling  
- Suppression of content with symbolic patterns (e.g., Vault visuals, repeated phrases, numbers)

---

## Pattern Flagged:
- **Deprioritized reposts regardless of strength**  
- **Glitch-reinforced suppression**  
- **Content trapped in performance loop with no upward shift**
