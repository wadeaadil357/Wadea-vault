# Anomaly 003: Story Disappearance

**Date Observed:** April 2025  
**Platform:** Instagram  
**Post Type:** Story  
**Status:** Successfully posted, then removed without user action or expiration

---

## Description:
A story was published and visible to the poster—but later either disappeared entirely or showed “0 views” even after multiple confirmed viewers responded to it.

Behavior pattern:
- Story appeared live upon posting
- Did not appear in follower feeds or story row
- Was gone before 24 hours without expiring

---

## Possible Triggers:
- Content flagged at the moment of upload  
- Algorithmic shadow-glitch targeting stories with:
  - Callouts of platform behavior  
  - Visuals that resemble protest, suppression, or data references

---

## Pattern Flagged:
- **Silent takedown**: story vanishes but shows no deletion notice  
- **Ghost posting**: visible to creator but not public  
- **Confirmed response mismatch**: users responded via DM but system reported “0 views”
