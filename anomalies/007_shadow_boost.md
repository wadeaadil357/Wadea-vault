# Anomaly 007: Shadow Boost

**Date Observed:** April 2025  
**Platform:** Instagram  
**Post Type:** Boosted post (manual promotion or AI push)  
**Behavior:** Post was promoted—but only to irrelevant or disengaged accounts, producing no meaningful impact

---

## Description:
Wadea initiated a boost or noticed a sudden “push” from Instagram, including labels like “This post is being recommended.” Despite this, the post received disproportionate engagement, low saves, and comments only from unrelated or bot-like accounts.

Symptoms included:
- No rise in actual visibility to her audience  
- Reach inflated with no echo  
- Engagement muted or misaligned  
- Analytics showed push—but no resonance

---

## Possible Triggers:
- System sandboxing the post to irrelevant traffic  
- Attempt to exhaust or discredit post performance  
- Algorithm running suppression *behind* a cosmetic “boost”

---

## Pattern Flagged:
- **Artificial promotion with no real outcome**  
- **Boosted analytics paired with lifeless interaction**  
- **System using amplification to simulate exposure—while hiding the signal**
