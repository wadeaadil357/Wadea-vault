# Anomaly 005: Silent Follower Drop

**Date Observed:** April 2025  
**Platform:** Instagram  
**Post Type:** Profile-wide behavior anomaly  
**Behavior:** Sudden follower count reduction without user activity

---

## Description:
Follower count dropped unexpectedly over a short span of hours/days—without posting controversial content, violating any guidelines, or changing engagement patterns.

Additional red flags:
- No notifications of unfollows  
- Followers confirmed they were removed without action  
- New follows didn’t reflect in count

---

## Possible Triggers:
- Platform-wide recalibration event targeting non-engagement accounts  
- Targeted suppression after high-activity post  
- System manipulation to destabilize perceived momentum

---

## Pattern Flagged:
- **No user engagement drop before follower loss**  
- **Posts during that time received consistent or increasing reactions**  
- **Hidden removal (silent unfollows) confirmed via user reports**
